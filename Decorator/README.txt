---> Is the lab completed? Or what percent of the lab is completed?
     Yes the lab is completed 100%
---> Time spent :
     10-15 hours
---> Major issues, new things learned?
     button click with timer was quite hard
     hard to call a variable that is declared on the function block level
     learnt how to use the function as variable

     ---> the button bush will do the 3 things we were asked to do:
         1. Increase the size
         2. align text right
         3. increase the existing font by 2 pt each 500ms
         4. the code for the hello word is created but it was commented out as it was stoping the code each time.
---> Any further questions and concerns etc.
     None so far
